# Arduino Rubik's Cube Solving Robot #

I used an Arduino UNO board, three servos and 3D printed parts to build a robot that was able to solve the Rubik's Cube autonomously

In this repository you can also find the complete program, the circuit scheme (which is very simple) and the files that contain the 3D parts that I printed
